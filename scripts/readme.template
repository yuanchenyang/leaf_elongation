## Stitching images

Stitch to get the relative locations of sequential two images in the folder

<<stitching.py>>

## Merging images

Run after stitching to see stitching results

<<merge_imgs.py>>

## Image directionality

Plot distribution of edges in leaf and infer leaf directionality from this distribution.

<<directionality.py>>

## Cell diameters

Get cell sizes, extract ROI coordinates and ferretâ€™s diameters

<<cell_diameter.py>>

## Pairwise distances

Measure two trichome(or any ROI) distances, can change scaling factors to make sure along leaf axis, can also check results and adjust parameters

<<cell_pairwise_dist.py>>

## Filter masks

Remove small masks (usually noise) of mask-like files in the folder, check help to change pattern of files

<<filter_mask_png.py>>

## Shrink images

Shrink images by reducing their width. This is usually needed if the cells are
too long and have too high an aspect ratio where they cannot be recognized by Cellpose.

<<shrink_width.py>>

## Visualize masks

<<visualize_masks.py>>

## Filter sister cells using stomata

<<filter_sister_cells_using_stomata.py>>

## Curve fitting

Fit a sigmoid curve to cell size against cell location

<<curve_fitting.py>>
